# Biography

I am a self directed investor, Investment Advisor Representative (AZ), and quantitative market researcher.  My trading strategy is based on options trading in liquid underlyings with risk managed at order entry.  Using volatilty and probability to select trades you can choose your risk profile and expected rate of return.  I present details about this strategy and research at a monthly meetup in Scottsdale AZ.  I hope you can join us!
